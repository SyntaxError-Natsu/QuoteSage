{"quote":"\u201cfor me, trees have always been the most penetrating preachers. i revere them when they live in tribes and families, in forests and groves. and even more i revere them when they stand alone. they are like lonely persons. not like hermits who have stolen away out of some weakness, but like great, solitary men, like beethoven and nietzsche. in their highest boughs the world rustles, their roots rest in infinity; but they do not lose themselves there, they struggle with all the force of their lives for one thing only: to fulfil themselves according to their own laws, to build up their own form, to represent themselves. nothing is holier, nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful, strong tree. when a tree is cut down and reveals its naked death-wound to the sun, one can read its whole history in the luminous, inscribed disk of its trunk: in the rings of its years, its scars, all the struggle, all the suffering, all the sickness, all the happiness and prosperity stand truly written, the narrow years and the luxurious years, the attacks withstood, the storms endured. and every young farmboy knows that the hardest and noblest wood has the narrowest rings, that high on the mountains and in continuing danger the most indestructible, the strongest, the ideal trees grow. trees are sanctuaries. whoever knows how to speak to them, whoever knows how to listen to them, can learn the truth. they do not preach learning and precepts, they preach, undeterred by particulars, the ancient law of life. a tree says: a kernel is hidden in me, a spark, a thought, i am life from eternal life. the attempt and the risk that the eternal mother took with me is unique, unique the form and veins of my skin, unique the smallest play of leaves in my branches and the smallest scar on my bark. i was made to form and reveal the eternal in my smallest special detail. a tree says: my strength is trust. i know nothing about my fathers, i know nothing about the thousand children that every year spring out of me. i live out the secret of my seed to the very end, and i care for nothing else. i trust that god is in me. i trust that my labor is holy. out of this trust i live. when we are stricken and cannot bear our lives any longer, then a tree has something to say to us: be still! be still! look at me! life is not easy, life is not difficult. those are childish thoughts. let god speak within you, and your thoughts will grow silent. you are anxious because your path leads away from mother and home. but every step and every day lead you back again to the mother. home is neither here nor there. home is within you, or home is nowhere at all. a longing to wander tears my heart when i hear trees rustling in the wind at evening. if one listens to them silently for a long time, this longing reveals its kernel, its meaning. it is not so much a matter of escaping from one's suffering, though it may seem to be so. it is a longing for home, for a memory of the mother, for new metaphors for life. it leads home. every path leads homeward, every step is birth, every step is death, every grave is mother. so the tree rustles in the evening, when we stand uneasy before our own childish thoughts: trees have long thoughts, long-breathing and restful, just as they have longer lives than ours. they are wiser than we are, as long as we do not listen to them. but when we have learned how to listen to trees, then the brevity and the quickness and the childlike hastiness of our thoughts achieve an incomparable joy. whoever has learned how to listen to trees no longer wants to be a tree. he wants to be nothing except what he is. that is home. that is happiness.\u201d","author":"herman hesse,","tags":[],"combined_text_for_embedding":"Quote: \u201cfor me, trees have always been the most penetrating preachers. i revere them when they live in tribes and families, in forests and groves. and even more i revere them when they stand alone. they are like lonely persons. not like hermits who have stolen away out of some weakness, but like great, solitary men, like beethoven and nietzsche. in their highest boughs the world rustles, their roots rest in infinity; but they do not lose themselves there, they struggle with all the force of their lives for one thing only: to fulfil themselves according to their own laws, to build up their own form, to represent themselves. nothing is holier, nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful, strong tree. when a tree is cut down and reveals its naked death-wound to the sun, one can read its whole history in the luminous, inscribed disk of its trunk: in the rings of its years, its scars, all the struggle, all the suffering, all the sickness, all the happiness and prosperity stand truly written, the narrow years and the luxurious years, the attacks withstood, the storms endured. and every young farmboy knows that the hardest and noblest wood has the narrowest rings, that high on the mountains and in continuing danger the most indestructible, the strongest, the ideal trees grow. trees are sanctuaries. whoever knows how to speak to them, whoever knows how to listen to them, can learn the truth. they do not preach learning and precepts, they preach, undeterred by particulars, the ancient law of life. a tree says: a kernel is hidden in me, a spark, a thought, i am life from eternal life. the attempt and the risk that the eternal mother took with me is unique, unique the form and veins of my skin, unique the smallest play of leaves in my branches and the smallest scar on my bark. i was made to form and reveal the eternal in my smallest special detail. a tree says: my strength is trust. i know nothing about my fathers, i know nothing about the thousand children that every year spring out of me. i live out the secret of my seed to the very end, and i care for nothing else. i trust that god is in me. i trust that my labor is holy. out of this trust i live. when we are stricken and cannot bear our lives any longer, then a tree has something to say to us: be still!

trail back to a burning house so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire to see if you can save him. or else, find the boy who lit the fire in the first place to see if you can change him.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdbut i know that she will anyway, so instead i\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll always keep an extra supply of chocolate and rain boats nearby, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccause there is no heartbreak that chocolate can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fix. okay, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a few heartbreaks chocolate can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fix. but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the rain boots are for, because rain will wash away everything if you let it.i want her to see the world through the underside of a glass bottom boat, to look through a magnifying glass at the galaxies that exist on the pin point of a human mind. because that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how my mom taught me. that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be days like this, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be days like this my momma said\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when you open your hands to catch and wind up with only blisters and bruises. when you step out of the phone booth and try to fly and the very people you wanna save are the ones standing on your cape. when your boots will fill with rain and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be up to your knees in disappointment and those are the very days you have all the more reason to say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thank you,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccause there is nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline no matter how many times it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sent away.you will put the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in win some lose some, you will put the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153star\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in starting over and over, and no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life.and yes, on a scale from one to over-trusting i am pretty damn naive but i want her to know that this world is made out of sugar. it can crumble so easily but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153baby,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd i\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll tell her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remember your mama is a worrier but your papa is a warrior and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes who never stops asking for more.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdremember that good things come in threes and so do bad things and always apologize when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done something wrong but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you ever apologize for the way your eyes refuse to stop shining.your voice is small but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ever stop singing and when they finally hand you heartbreak, slip hatred and war under your
